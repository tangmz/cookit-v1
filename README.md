# Cookit Mobile

This is a A* awarded Final Year Project that was developed using Flutter and Firebase technology. 
Cookit Mobile is a smart all-in-one application that was developed during 2022 where OpenAI first released their GPT model. We demonstrated the use of A.I. with a cooking recipe mobile application where images and descriptions of a recipe can be generated from A.I. 

This serves as the tool of easing user's social lifestyle particularly in the domain of house cooks in making recipes and sharing them as a hobby. We aim to foster more people in cooking and sharing cooking recipe as a form of new social media trend. This idea was inspired during the Covid19 era where people were suffering from the boredom due to a global lockdown.

One interesting feature with this mobile application is that it uses proximity sensor that is available in 99% of the Android smart phones to control the recipe pages. This function is inspired from the AirGesture sensor that was firstly introduced by Samsung Galaxy series phones but was later excluded in later phone releases. We aim to bring back similar functionality so that users with greasy hand during cooking don't need to swipe their fingers on the phone screen.

Disability support is also included in the mobile app, where people with visual disability get to listen to cooking instructions on each step and this bring so much conveinience to the users even when they are just too busy from looking at the pot without losing focus between the stove and the screen.
